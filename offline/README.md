# SeaLines Offline Build

This folder contains a pre-built static snapshot of the SeaLines skirmish sandbox.  Open `client/index.html` in any modern browser to play without running a local web server or installing Node.js packages.

If you update the source, regenerate this directory by running `npm run build:offline` from the repository root (see the main README for details).
